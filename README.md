# Blockchain_Python
## Description
Blockchain peer-to-peer app with mutual exclusion and threads.

## Getting started
First install all packages inside requirements.txt using the "pip install" command. After that execute the app on three different ports: 5000, 5001 and 5002. This can be done with the simple command "python Blockchain_app.py -p 5000" (repeat it for each port). Eventually, run Blockchain_requests.py (this is a test file, to try the different functions implemented on the app) and you will see the following output in you shell/bash terminal.

![localhost:5000](https://github.com/SeroviICAI/Blockchain_Python/blob/master/images/localhost5000_screenshot.jpg)
localhost:5000

![localhost:5001](https://github.com/SeroviICAI/Blockchain_Python/blob/master/images/localhost5001_screenshot.jpg)
localhost:5001

![localhost:5002](https://github.com/SeroviICAI/Blockchain_Python/blob/master/images/localhost5002_screenshot.jpg)
localhost:5002

You may use Postman to try this application too. New files will be created on the app's directory which will be backup copies of the blockchain.
